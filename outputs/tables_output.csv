seen in congestive heart failure, polycythemia ,sickle cell anemia, hypo fibrinogenemia , etc.

"Interpretation:
Adults and children
Increased total bilirubin that is mainly unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin may be a result of:-
1. Hemolytic or pernicious anemia
2. Transfusion reaction
3. Cirrhosis
4. A relatively common inherited condition called Gilbert syndrome, due to low levels of the enzyme that produces conjugated bilirubin.
Newborns
An elevated bilirubin level in a newborn may be temporary and resolve itself within a few days to two weeks. However, if the bilirubin level is
above a critical threshold or increases rapidly, an investigation of the cause is needed so appropriate treatment can be initiated. Increased
bilirubin concentrations may result from the accelerated breakdown of red blood cells due to:
1. Blood type incompatibility between the mother and her newborn
2. Certain congenital infections
3. Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)
4. Diseases that can affect the liver
In most of these conditions, only unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is increased.",,,

2. Suspected bacterial infection—a high CRP level can provide indication that patient has an infection.
3. Chronic inflammatory disease—high levels of CRP suggest a flare-up if you have a chronic inflammatory disease or that treatment has not
been effective.
If the CRP level is initially elevated and drops, it means that the inflammation or infection is subsiding and/or responding to treatment.",,,

1.Titres >1:80 of “O” antigen & >1:160 of “H” antigen for Salmonella typhi and titres >1:80 of “H” antigen for Salmonella paratyphi A & B are
reactive.
2. Rising titres in paired samples taken 7-10 days apart are more significant than a single test.
3. Reactive results indicates ongoing or recent infection by Salmonella spp. and the diagnosis should be confirmed by gold standard test such
as Blood culture.
4. The reactivity will vary with stage of the disease with appearance in 1st week to increase in titres till end of 4th week post which it starts
decreasing.
5. In TAB vaccinated patients, high titres of H antibody of ≥1:160 to each of Salmonellae is observed. They tend to persist for many months and
even years while O antibody shows lower titres and disappears within 6 months.
6. Antibiotic treatment during 1st week before the appearance of antibodies tend to supress the immune response in the form of no or
decreasing antibody levels.
7. False positive results/anamnestic response may be seen in patients with past enteric infection and during unrelated fevers like Malaria,
Influenzae etc. in the form of transient rise in H antibody in Widal test.
8. False negative results may be due to processing of sample collected early in the course of disease (1st week) and immunosuppression.
9. Test conducted on serum.
Uses
To diagnose infection due to Salmonella spp. (Enteric fever).
To monitor the progression of disease.
To assess the response to therapy (decreasing titres) in patients being treated for Enteric fever",,,

BIOLOGICAL REFERANCE INTERVAL
NEGATIVE <1.0

Note: As per regulation, specimen collecting Laboratory is responsible for reporting positive Dengue cases to Municipal corporation.
Indication: The Dengue (NS1) Antigen assay is a Enzyme linked immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of Dengue virus NS1 Antigen in human serum or
plasma(heparin).
The serological detection of the highly specific dengue virus NS1antigen in patients with a dengue virus infection is possible at the onset of clinical symptoms in
primary as well as secondary infections. Thus determination of Dengue (NS1) Antigen is an important supportive aid for diagnosis of acute dengue virus
infections.
Clinical background: Dengue virus (serotypes Den 1, Den 2, Den 3, Den 4) is a flavivirus with global distribution and is transmitted by mosquitoes ( Aedes
aegyptii, Aedes albopictus etc). It may cause Dengue fever, Dengue haemorrhagic fever or Dengue Shock syndrome.
Following the dengue infection, an incubation period of 3 to7 days, some infections maybe asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients develop fever with or without
rash, severe musculoskeletal pain, headache, retro-orbital pain, petechiae etc. In most individuals there is resolution of illness without complications. In some
individuals the Dengue fever may progress to Dengue haemorrhagic fever or Dengue Shock syndrome especially during repeat infection with a new Dengue
Virus serotype.
Dengue virus antigen usually appears in blood within 24 hours of onset of symptoms to symptoms till 9 days post onset of symptoms.
Positive: The presence of Dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen is consistent with acute infection with dengue virus. The NS1 antigen is typically
detectable within 1 to 2 days following infection and up to 9 days following symptom onset. NS1 antigen may also be detectable during secondary dengue virus
infection, but for a shorter duration of time (1-4 days following symptom onset).
Negative: The absence of dengue NS1 antigen is suggestive of absence of acute phase of the infection. The NS1 antigen may be negative if specimen is
collected too early such as immediately following dengue virus infection (<24-48 hours) or is collected following 9 to 10 days of symptoms. Results should always
be interpreted in conjunction with clinical presentation and exposure history.
Limitations: Uncommonly, false positive Dengue NS1 antigen results may be seen in individuals with other flaviviruses west nile virus as well as Yellow fever.
Negative NS1 antigen results may occur if the specimen was collected greater than 7 days following symptom onset. Serologic testing for the presence of IgM
and IgG antibodies to Dengue Virus is recommended in such cases.",,,

Comments
Dengue viruses belong to the family Flaviviridae and have 4 subtypes (1-4). Dengue virus is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti and
Aedes albopictus, widely distributed in Tropical and Subtropical areas of the world. Dengue is considered to be the most important arthropod

"Interpretation:
URINALYSIS- Routine urine analysis assists in screening and diagnosis of various metabolic, urological, kidney and liver disorders.
Protein: Elevated proteins can be an early sign of kidney disease. Urinary protein excretion can also be temporarily elevated by strenuous
exercise, orthostatic proteinuria, dehydration, urinary tract infections and acute illness with fever
Glucose: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can lead to presence of glucose in urine. Other causes include pregnancy, hormonal disturbances,
liver disease and certain medications.
Ketones: Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can lead to presence of ketones in urine. Ketones can also be seen in starvation, frequent vomiting,
pregnancy and strenuous exercise.
Blood: Occult blood can occur in urine as intact erythrocytes or haemoglobin, which can occur in various urological, nephrological and bleeding
disorders.
Leukocytes: An increase in leukocytes is an indication of inflammation in urinary tract or kidneys. Most common cause is bacterial urinary tract
infection.
Nitrite: Many bacteria give positive results when their number is high. Nitrite concentration during infection increases with length of time the
urine specimen is retained in bladder prior to collection.
pH: The kidneys play an important role in maintaining acid base balance of the body. Conditions of the body producing acidosis/ alkalosis or
ingestion of certain type of food can affect the pH of urine.
Specific gravity: Specific gravity gives an indication of how concentrated the urine is. Increased specific gravity is seen in conditions like
dehydration, glycosuria and proteinuria while decreased specific gravity is seen in excessive fluid intake, renal failure and diabetes insipidus.
Bilirubin: In certain liver diseases such as biliary obstruction or hepatitis, bilirubin gets excreted in urine.
Urobilinogen: Positive results are seen in liver diseases like hepatitis and cirrhosis and in cases of haemolytic anaemia.",,,
